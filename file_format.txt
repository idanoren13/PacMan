Each line in pacman_*.steps file represents one iteration
command of the game and it constructed as follows:

Every two integers represents position of a creature.
So first two integers are the position of PacMan, then Ghosts positions (position for rach ghost).
In case there is an appearance of a fruit there will be an extra position along with the value of the fruit.

For example, a command containing fruit will be displayed as follows:
//creature:  pacman ghost1 ... ghostk fruit value
actual line:   x y   x y   ...   x y   x y   5-9
